# CUSTOM MEDIA QUERIES

# Media query values can be changed to fit your own content.
# There are no magic bullets when it comes to media query width values.
# They should be declared in em units - and they should be set to meet
# the needs of your content. You can also add additional media queries,
# or remove some of the existing ones.
